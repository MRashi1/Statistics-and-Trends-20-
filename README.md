Exploratory Data Analysis Report

Introduction:
In this report, we conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains various attributes related to heart disease diagnosis, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more. Our goal is to uncover insights and patterns within the data to better understand the factors associated with heart disease.

Dataset Overview:
The "Heart Disease UCI" dataset comprises of 303 observations and 14 features. This dataset contains data from patients examined for heart disease. It has been used extensively for research in cardiovascular medicine and machine learning. Each instance represents a patient, and the target variable indicates whether the patient has heart disease (1) or not (0). This will give us an initial understanding of the variables present in the dataset.

Descriptive Statistics:
This will provide a comprehensive overview of the major moments for the numerical features in the dataset, including mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. This provides a comprehensive overview of the major moments for the numerical features in the dataset, including mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.

Correlation Analysis:
The correlation matrix reveals correlations between numerical variables in the dataset. For example, there is a moderate positive correlation between age and cholesterol levels, suggesting that cholesterol levels tend to increase with age.

Data Visualization:
Now, let's visualize some key aspects of the dataset using various types of plots.

1.	Categorical Graph:
    Histogram:
    The histogram of patients' ages indicates that the majority of patients in the dataset are between 50 and 70 years old. This histogram helps us understand the distribution of ages among patients in the        dataset.

2.	Relational Graph:

    Line/Scatter Graph:
    The scatter plot of age vs cholesterol levels does not show a clear relationship between the two variables. This scatter plot allows us to examine the relationship between age and cholesterol levels among     patients.

3.	Statistical Graph

    Heatmap:
    Finally, let's generate a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix computed earlier. This heatmap provides a graphical representation of the correlation matrix, making it easier to identify patterns        and relationships between features.



Conclusion:
Through exploratory data analysis, we have gained insights into the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset, uncovering relationships and patterns that may be associated with heart disease. Further analysis and modeling can be conducted to delve deeper into these relationships and understand the factors contributing to heart disease diagnosis.
